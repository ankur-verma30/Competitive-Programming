## About

Competitive programming is an exciting field that involves solving challenging algorithmic problems within a specified time limit. This repository is a collection of my solutions to these problems from various online platforms, contests, and coding challenges.

The solutions are implemented in various programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and more. Each problem is organized into its own directory, named appropriately to reflect the problem's name or the platform it was solved on.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and browse through the different problem directories. Each directory contains the solution code, along with a description of the problem statement and any additional notes or explanations.

To use the code, you can simply navigate to the desired problem directory and find the solution file. The code is generally well-commented and includes relevant explanations to help you understand the approach and implementation.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have solved additional competitive programming questions and would like to contribute your solutions, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows good coding practices and includes appropriate documentation.

If you find any issues with the existing solutions, such as bugs or optimizations, or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the repository. Your feedback is valuable in making this repository a reliable resource for competitive programmers.
